# Data-Analysis-Using-AWS-QuickSight
💡 Serverless Expense Tracker using AWS QuickSight A cloud-based solution to track expenses using S3 for data storage and QuickSight 📊 for real-time visualizations. Data is connected via manifest.json, enabling a fully serverless, secure, and scalable system for smart expense insights. 💸

📘 Project: Serverless Expense Tracker with AWS QuickSight

This project is a cloud-native, serverless solution designed to simplify expense tracking and analysis using AWS services. Users upload their expense data in CSV format to an Amazon S3 bucket, along with a manifest.json file that defines the structure of the dataset. AWS QuickSight is then granted access to the S3 bucket through this manifest URI, enabling seamless data ingestion.

Once the data is connected, AWS QuickSight is used to build interactive dashboards that provide real-time insights into spending patterns, categories, and trends. These visualizations help users better understand their financial behavior without any need for infrastructure management.

The architecture follows best practices for scalability, security, and automation:

Serverless Setup: No EC2 or manual server management involved.

Secure Data Storage: S3 bucket encryption and IAM roles ensure data privacy.

Dynamic Visualization: QuickSight dashboards auto-update with new data uploads.

This solution is ideal for individuals or small businesses looking for a lightweight, cost-effective, and insightful way to manage their finances using AWS. 💸📊🚀
